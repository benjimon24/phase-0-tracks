<!-- 		Release 4: Reflect
You can do this on your own after the pairing session.

At the bottom of your individual HTML page, create a comment where you reflect on the challenge. Answer the following questions within that block comment:

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	HTML5 semantic tags help add structure to your page. It breaks down your page into different sections, not only making your HTML much easier to read but also allowing CSS to target different sections specifically. I think the most useful one for me is simply the <div> tag because it is something I will be using very often.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	The browser displays elements from top to bottom of your HTML code. 
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	My guide and pair partner taught me some very valuable shortcuts for commenting out bits of code and for selecting multiple pieces of text that are the same. We also learned about creating snippets and created another one for HTML that was more detailed. I'll definitely be creating more snippets when I find myself reusing the same bits of code over and over again.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	Nothing was particularly difficult in this challenge. I got confused about which tags to use when creating a table and I still haven't memorized the proper structure for anchor tags but this will all improve as I practice more.
