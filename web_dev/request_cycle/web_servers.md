#What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

One key philosophy is to put all the power into the user's hands. While Windows and Mac's try to give their users a beginner-friendly interface, Linux is built with the expectation that the user knows what he/she is doing. Linux is open-source so the code can be shared and learned from by others. When creating programs, the philosophy emphasizes simplicity and modularity. Programs should do one thing and do it well. Programs should also be built to work well with other programs. 

#In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

It is a remote computer that you can connect to over the internet to run software for you. Typically VPS's are sold as a service and are a much more affordable option than buying server hardware yourself. They are useful because they can have hardware specs that your computer might not have. Also, you can keep the server running the entire day - something you might not want to do on your personal computer. They are often very quick to set up compared to installing and setting up different OS's and programs on your own machine. 

#Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

The root user has full permissions and access to everything on the Linux system. This can be a huge security issue if you run programs that can compromise the security of your system, as running the program as the root user will give that program full permissions as well.
