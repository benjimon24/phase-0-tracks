# What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

A GET request is when the client requests data from a server. A POST request is when you submit data to be processed by a server. You might submit a GET request when you first connect to a server and need to render their webpage. You might submit a POST request when you fill out a web form.

# Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

A cookie is a piece of data that is sent over to the user's web browser. The web browser may then store it and send it back so that the server can recognize the user and remember different pieces of information about them.
