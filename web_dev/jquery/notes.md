# Learning jQuery Plan
1. Spend about 2 hours learning jQuery on Codecademy.
2. Research quick tutorials and cheatsheets for jQuery

# Most Effective Strategies
	
	I find that Codeacademy is an incredible resource for learning basic level coding for a variety of different languages and libraries. However, the free course takes way longer than 2 hours to complete so I will probably have to revisit it some other time. After I felt that I had a basic understanding of jQuery I tried searching on Google for other handy resources that would be helpful when I need to quickly look up a function or syntax.
